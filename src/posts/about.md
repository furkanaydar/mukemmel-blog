Hi! I am Furkan, a senior Computer Engineering student at Bogazici University.
I also work as associate software engineer at [Sahibinden](https://sahibinden.com)

I am currently focused on fullstack programming, yet I have huge interest in game
development and I love reading about deep learning. I am also into music and I am
planning to share my guitar loops, beats and samples here too. I am also into music and I am
