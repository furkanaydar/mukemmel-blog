Hi! I am Furkan, a senior Computer Engineering student at Bogazici University.
I also work as associate software engineer at [Sahibinden](https://sahibinden.com)

I am currently focused on fullstack programming, yet I have huge interest in game
development and I love reading about deep learning. I am also into music and 
planning to share my guitar loops, beats and samples here too. In short, there will
be many content and improvement on this blog. Keep following!
